3. Write a program in C to read 10 numbers from keyboard and find their sum and average.

#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{       
    int i,n,sum=0;
	float avg;
	printf("Enter 10 numbers : \n");
	for (i=1;i<=10;i++)
	{
                printf(" %d",i);

		scanf("%d",&n);
		sum = sum + n;
	}
	
	avg=sum/10.0;
	printf("The sum of 10 no is : %d\nThe Average is : %f\n",sum,avg);
 
}
